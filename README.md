## Abstract
The project aims to find solution for feeding the growing population of the world. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050 and one of the greatest challenge for food and agriculture organisations is to feed such a huge population. These solutions range from changing the way we grow our food to changing the way we eat. To make things harder, the world’s climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food – agriculture. For instance, Cow is well know methane gas giant. Methane, the 2nd most warming gas after CO2, and a particularly potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. As per CBS news article on “How much methane cows releases when burping and passing gas” released on Oct 20, 2021, cows are responsible for about 40% of global methane emission which is passed or belched by the world’s 1.4 billion cattle. However, the bovine meat(beef) is a major red meat source around the glove. As per the data since 1961 to 2013 an average of 44,408,870 tonnes of beef is consumed each year around the globe. Considering average weight of a cow as 1000 kilograms leads us to production and slaughtering of 44,408,870 livestock per year.

## Dataset Description
This dataset was meticulously gathered, organized and published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilization of each food item available: Food - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food Feed - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.
